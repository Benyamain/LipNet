# LipNet üó£Ô∏è

Focuses on decoding text from a speaker's mouth movements. By using deep learning techniques and advanced models, such as LipNet, the project achieves impressive accuracy in mapping video frames to text. With its end-to-end training approach and utilization of spatiotemporal convolutions and recurrent networks, LipNet outperforms previous methods and even surpasses human lip readers in sentence-level accuracy.
